## üõçÔ∏è Project 1: Handmade Goods E-Commerce Store

### **What?**  
A full-stack e-commerce website for handmade goods that allows users to browse products, manage carts, and complete purchases securely.

### **Why and How?**  
I built this project to demonstrate my ability to design and deploy a dynamic web application with full authentication, data persistence, and administrative control. Using **PHP**, **MySQL**, **JavaScript**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap**, I implemented both client- and server-side functionality. To improve responsiveness, I used **AJAX** for asynchronous updates to shopping cart and product listings.

### **When?**  
Completed in **April 2025** as part of my **COSC 360 Full-Stack Web Development course**.

### **Who and Where?**  
Collaborated with teammate **Dante [Last Name]**, under instructor supervision. Deployed to the **UBC COSC360 web server** using **GitHub version control**.

### **Outcomes:**  
- Implemented secure login, registration, and session management.  
- Designed responsive front-end layouts optimized for all devices.  
- Built relational database schemas for users, products, and orders.  
- Strengthened back-end development and SQL debugging skills.  

### **Digital Artifacts:**  
- üîó [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/frankwilz/handmade-store)  
- üñºÔ∏è Screenshots of the store front, admin panel, and checkout page.  
- üé• Demo video showing login, cart, and checkout workflows.

### **STAR Narrative**

**Situation:**  
As part of a full-stack development course, our team was challenged to design a production-ready e-commerce platform that simulated real-world online retail functionality.

**Task:**  
Our goal was to create a scalable e-commerce store featuring user accounts, product listings, and administrative tools ‚Äî all running on a **LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)** stack.

**Action:**  
I led back-end development, designing MySQL database schemas and implementing authentication using PHP sessions. I built interactive cart and product systems using **AJAX**, ensuring real-time updates. I also managed GitHub commits and reviewed code merges for quality and consistency.

**Result:**  
The site deployed successfully, meeting all functionality requirements. It received positive feedback from the instructor for seamless UX and secure architecture. I improved my ability to handle session management, database optimization, and responsive front-end design.

## üöó Project 2: Car Enthusiasts Forum Platform

### **What?**  
An interactive online forum where car enthusiasts can post questions, share updates, and discuss automotive topics.

### **Why and How?**  
This project showcases my UX-first design mindset and front-end development skills. I wanted to create a discussion space inspired by existing forums but tailored to modern usability standards. Using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **PHP**, I built a prototype allowing users to register, post, and comment. I conducted **user interviews** to identify key features and accessibility preferences (e.g., dark mode vs light mode).

### **When?**  
Completion in **December 2025** as part of my **Software Development Bootcamp (Circuit Stream)** portfolio module.

### **Who and Where?**  
Individual project, created under the mentorship of **Circuit Stream instructors**.

### **Outcomes:**  
- Developed a responsive prototype with modern UI and accessibility features.  
- Integrated user feedback from research interviews into design decisions.  
- Created forum post and comment components using vanilla JavaScript.  
- Strengthened my skills in UX research, prototyping, and usability testing.

### **Digital Artifacts:**  
- üîó [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/frankwilz/forum-platform)  
- üß≠ Wireframes and flow diagrams created in Draw.io.  
- üìä Usability testing notes and research summaries.

### **STAR Narrative**

**Situation:**  
During my bootcamp, I wanted to create a user-centered web forum to show my ability to balance functionality and visual comfort based on user feedback.

**Task:**  
Design a working prototype that demonstrates community interaction features while emphasizing accessibility, modern UI, and user comfort.

**Action:**  
I began by interviewing potential users to understand their frustrations with existing forums and preferences for visual design. Based on findings, I built wireframes in **Draw.io** and developed the prototype using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. I implemented a dark mode toggle and responsive layout for mobile and desktop views.

**Result:**  
The prototype successfully met all usability goals, with 90% of test participants preferring the dark-mode layout. The project highlighted my ability to combine **UX research** with **front-end development**, preparing me for full-stack forum implementation in future iterations.

‚≠ê **Next Steps:**  
I‚Äôm continuing to expand these projects by integrating **Node.js** and **REST APIs** to enhance scalability, and by refining UI accessibility for diverse audiences.
